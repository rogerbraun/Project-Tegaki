tegaki-zinnia-simplified-chinese
================================

Simplified Chinese handwriting model for Zinnia.

Requirements
------------

Build-dependency only:

tegaki-tools 0.2

Build
-----

/!\ This step is optional, you can skip it without risk.

We provide a pre-built model file (.model) for convenience but if you need to,
you can rebuild the model file from its original source (.xml) like so:

$ tegaki-build -t handwriting-zh_CN.xml zinnia handwriting-zh_CN.meta

Install
-------

($ su)
# python setup.py install

Model files
-----------

Model files (extension .model) contain the main handwriting model data.

Meta files
----------

Meta files (extension .meta) contain meta-data regarding model files. They
must be encoded in UTF-8. They are defined as key-value pairs, one per line.
Possible keys include:

* name: model full name (mandatory).
* shortname: name with less than 3 characters (mandatory).
* language: language code such as "ja" or "zh_CN" (optional).
* path: path of the associate model file. If the path is not specified,
        the model file is assumed to be in the same directory with the same base
        name and the .model extension. For example, if "file.meta" is present
        and it doesn't define a path key, the presence of "file.model" is
        assumed (optional).
