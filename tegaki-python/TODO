- Character transition model (bigram)

- API to retrieve the most suitable recognizer and model available for some task
  or given some requirements (language, characters included, stroke-order
  free...)

    -> This is useful for applications (e.g. games) that want to use Tegaki
       as a service without asking the user to explicitly choose a recognizer
       or model.
